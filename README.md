## Molecular Playground Expansion

### Project Overview
>The Molecular Playground is an system that displays large-scale interactive projections of molecules in public places. The equipment required for the system to function properly consists of a Kinect 360 Sensor, a computer with Mac OS X, the appropriate cables, and a screen or surface for the projection. *Team Dropout* is aiming to expand this system with out Molecular Playground Expansion. Our expansion consists of a web app for that will plug into the existing system and a central server that will create a repository for all the interactive molecules.

>As far as programming tools, we are using Javascript, Node JS, Express, and PostgreSQL

>Our web application will primarily be used for administration to monitor their installation of Molecular Playground. Authors that wish to upload their own interactive content will be able to use our application to do so. To get more of a high level overview of our system, refer to our High Level Design Document in the ~/Documentation/ folder.
