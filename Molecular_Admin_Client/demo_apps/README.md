###Node.js
- The adoption of Node.js by large players on the other hand is actively growing,
including PayPal, Netflix, Ebay, LinkedIn, Uber and others.
- If you want to leverage a dynamic and fast-growing ecosystem with tons of stuff 
already available for almost every use case you can think of, then go ahead and
make your bet on Node.js.
- 665 million downloads in the last month alone on npm.
- nodeJS is very simple, No dlls, no GAC, No classes. It is tiny, really tiny code.
- In general, use Node.js when you have highly I/O-bound operations that don’t use
much CPU. Use .NET when you need to calculate things and use a lot of CPU.
- asynchronous aspect in back-end can be an unnecessary difficulty when learning. 


###ASP.net
- enjoy the advantages of C#, F# and so on, then you’re doing nothing wrong with ASP.NET.
most things you need to build high-quality applications are already there in .NET.
- 325 million total package downloads on NuGet at all times
- Many .net projects has large codebase but it is easily readable. Debugable, Monitorable, 
profilable. A normal skilled team can manage C# codes in better manner.
- In fact, you can now write the “Hello World” asynchronous web server in .NET 
in about as few lines as Node.js!
-compiled language, any changes to the site need to save and compile to update

###flask
- Python is very simple and usable for back-end. If you compare Flask, Pyramid and Rails (with Ruby),
the more interesting framework to learn lot of stuff is Flask. 
Flask is not over-engineering compared to others. 
- Python 'threads' is also blocking, due to the GIL, they cannot run in parallel.
