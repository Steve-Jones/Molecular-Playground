##Node.js
-The adoption of Node.js by large players on the other hand is actively growing,
including PayPal, Netflix, Ebay, LinkedIn, Uber and others.
-If you want to leverage a dynamic and fast-growing ecosystem with tons of stuff 
already available for almost every use case you can think of, then go ahead and
make your bet on Node.js.
-665 million downloads in the last month alone on npm.
-nodeJS is very simple, No dlls, no GAC, No classes. It is tiny, really tiny code.
-In general, use Node.js when you have highly I/O-bound operations that don’t use
much CPU. Use .NET when you need to calculate things and use a lot of CPU.

##ASP.net
-enjoy the advantages of C#, F# and so on, then you’re doing nothing wrong with ASP.NET.
most things you need to build high-quality applications are already there in .NET.
-325 million total package downloads on NuGet at all times
-Many .net projects has large codebase but it is easily readable. Debugable, Monitorable, 
profilable. A normal skilled team can manage C# codes in better manner.
-In fact, you can now write the “Hello World” asynchronous web server in .NET 
in about as few lines as Node.js!
